Welcome to Seymour Island fellow educator! This guide contains a few useful pieces of information for running the Seymour Island world.   
   
First, some specifics   
- The world supports up to 30 players at once (including the teacher/s).
- The world is designed to be done in "virtual pairs". These could be 2 students sitting beside each other, or in their own call.   
    - Although not 100% necessary, it allows students to assist each other, even if a number of the tasks are actually single player.   
    - It also makes the multiplayer tasks a lot easier to already have pre-assigned pairs.   
- There are 9 total unique tasks (each with 2-3 copies), plus the initial task 0, which is copied for each player. These 9 tasks break out to:   
    - 6 single player tasks.
    - 3 multiplayer tasks.
