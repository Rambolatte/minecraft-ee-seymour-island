# Multiplayer circuits

```template
player.onItemInteracted(BLAZE_ROD, function () {
agent.place(FORWARD)
})
```

## Step 1

Before you get started, it is important you have a friend in the room beside you to 
help with this task, as it requires 2 players!
It is also recommended that you have completed the fixing circuits single player 
task before attempting this one.   
Once you are ready to proceed, hit the next button.   

## Step 2

This task involves repairing some circuits together, on a large scale.   
Look down into the circuit area. There are 4 quadrants, 2 of which you have to fix
and 2 that your friend has to fix. They feed into each other across the centre line.
The redstone current travels through the centre gold blocks. 
Note you can only place redstone on the **Green Emerald** blocks.  


## Step 3

Although you could write a program that had instructions for each block to check, why
not just build a program that scans for all emerald blocks, then places redstone?   
Let's start by using ``||agent:agent move left/right||`` to get your agent to a corner to start.

```blocks
agent.move(LEFT, 1)
```

## Step 4

Next, lets check if the block below us equals emerald.  
Start by adding a ``||logic:if then||``, with a ``||logic:0 = 0||`` block within it.   
In the first slot of this, use an ``||agent: agent inspect block down||`` to detect which block is below.   
Then on the right hand side, compare it against an Emerald Block.

```blocks
player.onItemInteracted(BLAZE_ROD, function () {
    agent.move(LEFT, 1)
    if (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block, DOWN) == EMERALD_BLOCK) {

    }
    }
```

##Â Step 5

Within this if statement, if it does correctly detect emerald, then lets place some redstone down using ``||agent:agent place down||``.   
We also want to move forward after our if statement is complete by 1, using ``||agent:agent move forward by 1||``.

```blocks
player.onItemInteracted(BLAZE_ROD, function () {
    agent.move(LEFT, 1)
    if (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block, DOWN) == EMERALD_BLOCK) {
        agent.place(DOWN)
    }
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
```

## Step 6

With our main piece of code now put together, we need to run this now 5 times to check each block in this row.
Put a ``||loops:repeat 5 times||`` around the if statement and the agent move forward blocks.   
Also make sure to move the agent back again once done, using ``||agent:agent move back by 5||`` after the loop.

```blocks
player.onItemInteracted(BLAZE_ROD, function () {
    agent.move(LEFT, 1)
        for (let index = 0; index < 5; index++) {
            if (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block, DOWN) == EMERALD_BLOCK) {
                agent.place(DOWN)
            }
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        }
        agent.move(BACK, 5)
})
```

## Step 7

Try now to put run this all within a second loop, moving around each row one after each other.   
This second loop should go around everything except the initial move left/right block.   


```blocks
player.onItemInteracted(BLAZE_ROD, function () {
    agent.move(LEFT, 1)
    for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
        for (let index = 0; index < 5; index++) {
            if (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block, DOWN) == EMERALD_BLOCK) {
                agent.place(DOWN)
            }
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        }
        agent.move(BACK, 5)
        agent.move(RIGHT, 1)
    }
})
```

```ghost
agent.place(FORWARD)
```
